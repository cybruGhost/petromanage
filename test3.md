<p><b>Cubic Music</b> is an evolving streaming app focused on smooth music playback and user experience.  
- While it might not be as polished as some mature apps yet, it's a solid, good-looking, and lightweight alternative.  
- The project is maintained and will only be updated when I fix bugs or add features as I learn Kotlin skills!</p>

**⭐ STAR AND FOLLOW 😅 NOW!!! The way to go**

## 🆕 New feature (v1.7.6 soon)
### **Spotify Canvas(beta)**

**What is Spotify Canvas?**

<p>Spotify Canvas is a short, looping visual (3–8 second video) that appears in place of static album artwork while a song is playing in the Spotify mobile app. Instead of a still image, listeners see a subtle, animated visual that enhances the mood and identity of the track.

- Canvas videos are silent, vertical, and loop seamlessly, designed to complement music without distracting from it.<p>
