🎵 About Cubic Music
Cubic Music is an evolving streaming app focused on smooth music playback and user experience. While it might not be as polished as some mature apps yet, it's a solid, good-looking, and lightweight alternative. The project is maintained and will only be updated when I fix bugs or add features as I learn Kotlin skills!

Cubic Music is a very powerful, multilingual YouTube Music frontend for Android. It features streaming, full downloads, and stunning visuals—built with a sleek, modern UI focused on performance and user freedom.

What is Spotify Canvas?
Spotify Canvas is a short, looping visual (3–8 second video) that appears in place of static album artwork while a song is playing in the Spotify mobile app. Instead of a still image, listeners see a subtle, animated visual that enhances the mood and identity of the track.

Canvas videos are silent, vertical, and loop seamlessly

Designed to complement music without distracting from it

Enhances the visual experience of your music library
