<p><b>Cubic Music</b> is an evolving streaming app focused on smooth music playback and user experience. - While it might not be as polished as some mature apps yet, it's a solid, good-looking, and lightweight alternative. - The project is maintained and will only be updated when I fix bugs or add features as I learn Kotlin skills!</p>
⭐ STAR AND FOLLOW 😅 NOW!!! The way to go

New feature (v1.7.6 soon)
Spotify Canvas (beta)
What is Spotify Canvas?

<p>Spotify Canvas is a short, looping visual (3–8 second video) that appears in place of static album artwork while a song is playing in the Spotify mobile app. Instead of a still image, listeners see a subtle, animated visual that enhances the mood and identity of the track.
Canvas videos are silent, vertical, and loop seamlessly, designed to complement music without distracting from it.<p>
